The Task Manager Web App is a medium-level front-end project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create, complete, and delete tasks, helping them organize their daily to-do list. The project is designed with a clean, responsive interface that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

Upon loading the page, users are presented with an input box where they can type in new tasks and a button to add them. Each task added is displayed as a list item with a delete button and a click-to-complete feature. Clicking on a task marks it as completed by striking through the text, visually indicating progress. The delete button allows the user to remove tasks from the list with ease.

A key feature of this project is its use of localStorage. This ensures that tasks are saved in the browser and persist even after the user refreshes or closes the tab. When the page reloads, all tasks — including their completed states — are restored automatically from localStorage.

From a development perspective, this project introduces and reinforces core web development skills. It involves DOM manipulation, event handling, and state management using JavaScript. The CSS used ensures modern, aesthetic styling with clean layouts and responsive elements.

This task manager serves as an excellent stepping stone for learners looking to advance from basic to intermediate-level projects. It can also be extended with more advanced features like due dates, priority tags, drag-and-drop ordering, or user authentication using a backend like Firebase or Node.js.

In summary, the Task Manager Web App is a practical and expandable project that demonstrates essential web development skills while providing a useful productivity tool for end users.
